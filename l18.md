# Bandit Over The Wire (Write-ups)

## Level 18


Here we are asked to connect to a server hosted at name :- **bandit.labs.overthewire.org** at port -2220 .</br>
_Username_:- **bandit18** </br>
_Password_ :- **hga5tuuCLF6fFzUpnagiMN8ssu9LFrdg**
</br>
using ssh .

So, type :- </br>
```console
pheonix-singh@phoenix-singh ~/SDSLabs/git/Bandit-Writeups   
â–¶ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

firstly when you try to sh on bandit 18 server , it will give log out automatically bcoz prompt terminal on start call .bashrc file which is not there.

so we will use -T to not involve prompt terminal


```console

    ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -T
    ls
    readme
    cat readme
